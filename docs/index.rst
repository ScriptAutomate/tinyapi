.. warning::

    It's probably unwise to depend on TinyAPI for anything important. The library's functionality depends on an undocumented API. If that API changes, TinyAPI will likely break.

.. seealso::

    `tinystats <https://github.com/jsvine/tinystats>`_, a command-line tool for fetching data from the TinyLetter API. No programming knowledge required.
